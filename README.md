#### 7.4 - React + Director

The purpose of this project is to introduce ReactJS and incorporate a router (specifically, Flatiron's Director) by refactoring a single-page app from an earlier assignment.


After completing this assignment, there should be an understanding of how to:

 - break down an interface into components
 - create React components
 - create nested React components
 - fetch and re-render a React component to display fetched data
 - use a routing library in conjunction with React
